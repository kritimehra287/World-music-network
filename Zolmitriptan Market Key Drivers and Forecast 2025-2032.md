The increasing prevalence of migraine disorders, along with the growing demand for effective treatment options, is driving the market growth. The rising adoption of zolmitriptan as a preferred medication for acute migraine relief, especially in regions with high migraine incidence, is contributing to the expanding market size. The growing awareness about migraine treatment options, coupled with the favorable reimbursement policies for zolmitriptan in several regions, has also been a significant factor in market growth.
